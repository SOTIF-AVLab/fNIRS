For highly automated vehicles, the human being will serve as the role of passenger instead of the driver does not need to operate the vehicle, it makes the input of brain computer interface system of high-level automated vehicles change, and it depends on the passengers’ brain states rather than drivers’brain states. Especially when confronting corner cases, how to implement passengers’ metal states into safe driving is vital choice in the future. Quantifying the cognition of the driving risk of the passenger is the basis step to achieve this goal. However, most studies focus on the drivers’ mental activity based blood oxygen monitoring by fNIRS. In this paper, the relation between passengers’ mental activity in the prefrontal cortex and driving scenarios risk based blood oxygen monitoring by fNIRS technology is first studied. First, a signal acquisition system and challenging driving scenarios are designed by hardware-in-loop equipment and Virtual Test Drive software.  Second, this experiment is done on a driving simulator and 20 participants completed this experiment. Final, the data is analyzed by cerebral oxygen exchange index, and the results point out that mental activities of passengers caused by driving scenario risk in Brodmann 10 is very active, which is verified by analyzing the real-driving data collected in autonomous corresponding challenging experiments which performed in the experimental base in Changsha, China, and the linear relation between the cerebral oxygen exchange and a risk field is fitted out via generalized linear model approach. This initial finding provides a possible solution to design small-area brain computer interface system to promise safety driving for high-level automated vehicles by using passengers’ driving risk cognition.
